Maven:
------
JAVA_HOME
MAVEN_HOME - till bin directory
close all the command prompts opened and open a new command prompt to verify the changes

groupId + artifactId + version = unique combination(coordinates of the project)
Maven Life cycle:
-----------------
Generate a Project -> Execute Maven -> Install a Maven artifact -> Run the app
1. Validate: Validate the project is correct
2. Compile: Compile the source code of the project
3. Test: Test the compile source code using a unit testing framework
4. Package: Package the compiled code
5. Integration-test: Deploy the package into an environment where integration tests can be run
6. Verify: Run any checks to verify the package is valid
7. Install: Install the package into local repository
8. Deploy: Copies the final package to the remote repository
Maven Repository:
-----------------
1. Central
2. Local (~/.m2)
Dependency Management:
----------------------
https://search.maven.org/
Project Object Model:
---------------------
When adding dependencies, you can add the scope tag to indicate which life cycle phase uses this component.
scopes: compile(default), provided, runtime, test, and system.
Provided: is used when JDK is expected to provide them
Runtime: is required for executing and testing, not compiling
Project Relationships:
----------------------
All project relationships are established using Maven coordinates.
example: Log4j and jUnit
Best Practices: (Multi-Module vs Inheritance)
---------------
There are projects that have components that are totally unrelated to each other. 
But together, they are required to make a larger project.
This is an example when you should use a multi-module approach.
A reason to use inheritance occurs when projects have shared dependencies.
Maven Plugins:
--------------
A plugin is a collection of one or more goals
A goal is a "unit of work" in Maven.
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/index
to execute a single goal: mvn pluginname:goal
Core Plugins/Packaging types/Reporting Plugins/tools etc

mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.advitha -DartifactId=sample -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
mvn help:effective-pom
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.advitha -DartifactId=samplewebapp -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DinteractiveMode=false
